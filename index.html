                    showcase what I have to offer to the world! I am a driven and dedicated computer scientist and
                    mathematician that loves to learn new things. I often marvel at the great technological advancements
                    we have made even just during my lifetime, and I hope to be able to witness and, even better,
                    contribute to some of the next big changes in this vibrant industry. As someone who is constantly
                    tinkering with their computer, reinstalling their OS every few months, and hosting my own cloud
                    services on old self-built computers, I love what I study and I engage in it regularly.</p>
