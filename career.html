                <h3>Computer Science Degree</h3>
                <p class="little">I am pursuing a computer science degree, and have loved computers ever since I first got my hands on a Windows XP laptop as a kid. As my interest in programming grew over my lifetime, I knew it would be my career some day. I chose to get my BS in computer science at CU Boulder.</p>

                <h3>Applied Mathematics Degree</h3>
                <p class="little">I am also pursuing a degree in applied mathematics. I chose to get my BS in applied mathematics also at CU Boulder, at the same time as my computer science degree. I have always been good at math and have actually enjoyed it throughout school, so I decided that it would be interesting to learn more advanced topics regarding math.</p>

                <h3>UCHealth Rounding App</h3>
                <p class="little">I created a solution for patient experience surveys done by UCHealth's nurse leaders that consolidated their existing formats into one easy-to-use mobile application. This also allowed for better quantitative data gathering and analysis system-wide. This project was independently driven and developed during my summer internships at UCHealth, and is still in production use today.</p>
