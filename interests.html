                <h3>Skiing with Boulder Freeride</h3>
                <p class="little">Boulder Freeride is a student-run ski and snowboard club that makes for a great place
                    to meet new people to ski with and learn more about skiing in the process. I joined Freeride club
                    this year and love it! Everyone is very welcoming and great at skiing too. I have improved
                    significantly over this last ski season!</p>

                <h3>PC Building</h3>
                <p class="little">Since I was 15 I have been building and modifying my own custom desktop computers.
                    Now, nearly seven years since I first started, I can say I have finally achieved the dream setup
                    that little Dane would have always wanted. I still modify my computers and run custom services on
                    old hardware for fun!</p>

                <h3>Piano Playing & Composition</h3>
                <p class="little">I have been playing piano since long before I have even been interested in computers.
                    While my technique isn't perfect and I could probably sit with better posture, I still enjoy
                    learning a tough piece and trying to master it. I also enjoy writing my own songs and have written
                    many that I love to play for others!</p>
